# Findings

> **Generated file.** The findings ledger: review findings raised by `audit` against
> the work in progress, each with a durable identifier, a severity from P0 to P3, and a
> status. `implement` marks a repair `fixed`, a later `audit` pass moves it to
> `closed`, and `complete` refuses to finish while any P0 or P1 finding is `open` or
> `fixed`, then archives the resolved ones with the work and resets this file.

### F-01 [P1] fixed - Adapter flags match inherited object properties

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/args.ts:71
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: security, quality, tests)
**Why it matters:** `flag.slice(2) in ADAPTERS` walks the prototype chain, so `--toString`, `--constructor`, `--__proto__` and `--hasOwnProperty` parse as adapters. The grammar promises exit 2 for any unknown option; instead `religion install --toString --dry-run --yes` crashes with `ADAPTERS[adapter].trees is not iterable` and exits 1 (reproduced in a scratch directory; nothing was written). This is the surface a stable release will freeze.
**Suggested fix:** `Object.hasOwn(ADAPTERS, name)`, with refusal cases for `--toString` and `--__proto__` in `lib/args.test.ts`.
**Resolution:** Repaired 2026-09-26: adapter names are checked with `Object.hasOwn(ADAPTERS, name)`, and `lib/args.test.ts` asserts `--toString`, `--__proto__` and `--constructor` are refused. A real run of `religion install --toString --dry-run --yes` now exits 2. Awaiting re-review.

### F-02 [P2] open - The upper edge of the command suggestion is not pinned

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/args.test.ts:46
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: tests)
**Why it matters:** `stauts` pins distance 2, but the only no-suggestion case, `deploy`, is 4 or more from every command, so loosening `<= 2` to `<= 3` passes the suite.
**Suggested fix:** Assert `sta` (distance 3 from `status`) gets the no-suggestion message.
**Resolution:**

### F-03 [P2] open - The host check's wrong-port case is untested for localhost

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/dashboard.test.ts:22
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: tests)
**Why it matters:** Only `127.0.0.1` is tested with the wrong port. A regression to `startsWith("localhost:")` would pass every test while accepting any port, on the guard that closes DNS rebinding.
**Suggested fix:** Assert `localhost:4322` and `LOCALHOST:4322` are refused for port 4321.
**Resolution:**

### F-04 [P3] open - "Nothing was read" overstates what a usage error does

**File:** packages/create-religion/bin/religion.ts:238
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: security)
**Why it matters:** An unknown first word is checked with `statSync` before it is refused, so `religion stauts` stats `./stauts`. No contents are read and nothing is written, but the help text, the package readme and the changeset promise "nothing was read or written".
**Suggested fix:** Say "nothing was written" or "nothing was changed" in all three.
**Resolution:**

### F-05 [P3] open - Help text does not describe the grammar it enforces

**File:** packages/create-religion/bin/religion.ts:254
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** `status`, `doctor` and `dashboard` accept a directory but are listed without `[dir]`; the install-only flags do not say so although using them elsewhere is now a usage error; `-y`, `-h` and `help` are accepted but unlisted.
**Suggested fix:** Show `[dir]` on those commands and label the install flags as install and update only.
**Resolution:**

### F-06 [P3] open - Flag dispatch ends in a catch-all branch

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/args.ts:72
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** The known-flag list and the if/else chain duplicate each other, and the final `else options.yes = true` catches any other known flag, so a flag added to the list without its own branch silently becomes `--yes`.
**Suggested fix:** Make the last branch explicit, or drive scope and effect from one table.
**Resolution:**

### F-07 [P3] open - Thin coverage across flags and commands

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/args.test.ts:62
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: tests)
**Why it matters:** `--copilot` never appears; `--opencode` only as a refusal; no flag is tested with an explicit `install`; `--yes` with `update` and `-y` with `install` are untested; `--json` is refused only with `install`; `help` as a later positional is untested.
**Suggested fix:** One table-driven test over every flag and command, plus `["install", "a", "b", "help"]`.
**Resolution:**

### F-08 [P3] open - The suggestion's edit distance runs over the whole argument

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/args.ts:95
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: performance)
**Why it matters:** Bounded and on the error path only, but a 1,000,000-character argument takes about 390 ms and is echoed whole to stderr.
**Suggested fix:** Skip commands whose length differs by more than 2; the result is identical.
**Resolution:**

### F-09 [P3] open - Unused import and dead export in the dashboard

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/dashboard.ts:10
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** `import path` is unused (`tsc --noUnusedLocals` reports TS6133) and `historyCount` is exported and used nowhere. Both predate this work, in a file it touches.
**Suggested fix:** Delete both, after confirming nothing needs `historyCount`.
**Resolution:**

### F-10 [P3] unverified - A failed state read could crash the dashboard

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/dashboard.ts:24
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: security)
**Why it matters:** `void handle(...)` has no rejection handler, so a throw from `readProjectState` would be unhandled. Not reproduced. Predates this work.
**Suggested fix:** Catch in the request callback and answer 500.
**Resolution:**

### F-11 [P3] unverified - The package root is found before arguments are parsed

**File:** packages/create-religion/bin/religion.ts:58
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: quality)
**Why it matters:** `findPackageRoot` runs at module load, outside `main().catch`, so on an incomplete install even a usage error would exit 1 with an uncaught stack. Not run. Predates this work.
**Suggested fix:** Resolve the template lazily inside `main`.
**Resolution:**

### F-12 [P3] unverified - The manifest's adapter list is trusted unchecked

**File:** packages/create-religion/lib/install.ts:241
**Found:** 2026-09-26 by audit (scope: current; lens: security)
**Why it matters:** `readManifest` casts the JSON, so a manifest listing `__proto__` as an adapter would crash the way F-01 does. The file is the project's own. Predates this work.
**Suggested fix:** Filter adapters with `Object.hasOwn(ADAPTERS, name)` when reading.
**Resolution:**
